## Local Skill: guizang-ppt-skill

When the user asks for a web PPT, horizontal swipe deck, magazine-style PPT,
Swiss Style deck, or explicitly mentions guizang-ppt-skill, read and follow
the `guizang-ppt-skill/SKILL.md` file under the user's local Codex skills directory.

## Commit Privacy

- Never publish personal author or committer email addresses.
- For this repository, use `Plastic-time` and
  `247457381+Plastic-time@users.noreply.github.com` for both Git identities.
- Enable the repository hooks with `git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- Run `node tools/check-commit-privacy.cjs --identity` before committing and
  `node tools/check-commit-privacy.cjs --all` before publishing.
- Do not use connector commit/file-write tools that cannot set or guarantee
  both privacy-safe Git identities. Use authenticated Git with explicit identities.
- Never merge or force-push history from a clone predating the privacy cleanup.
  Re-clone or transfer reviewed file changes without importing old commits.
- Do not print discovered personal emails or credentials in logs or responses.
- GitHub account email privacy settings are separate from repository settings.
  Never claim those account settings were changed without verifying them.

## Game Data Authority

- Check https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine when reviewing game
  updates. Resolve a commit first, then read its version and configuration;
  never consume a moving branch as an unrecorded production snapshot.
- Run `node tools/check-datamine-updates.cjs` for a read-only update report in
  `logs/datamine-update-check.json`. This is an on-demand check, not a scheduled
  watcher or an automatic import. Review costs and user-confirmed corrections
  separately before applying changes; changed files alone do not prove changed
  player-facing prices or public availability.
- NEW vehicle badges mean additions in the current game major update compared
  with the preceding live major update, not newly scraped calculator entries.
  Review configuration differences against official release announcements to
  exclude dev-server, unreleased, renamed and model-only changes. Maintain
  `config/vehicle-release.json`; a new major version requires a fresh review.
- For future data updates, use version-pinned game configuration as the primary
  authority for vehicle and modification RP, Silver Lions, tiers, unlock counts,
  prerequisites, and modification membership. Record the game version and source
  revision; do not treat a partial correction as a full snapshot upgrade.
- Wiki is supplementary for names, images, and layout. Do not let Wiki costs,
  prerequisite edges, or obsolete modification entries override game data.
- Missing or conflicting game fields require review. Do not silently fill them
  from Wiki, interpret missing costs as zero, or expose internal-only prices as
  player purchase costs without verifying availability and currency semantics.
- Preserve explicitly user-confirmed in-game corrections with their provenance.
  If a later game configuration conflicts with one, report the difference before
  replacing it; keep the existing Ka-29, Do 217 J-2, and CA-27 corrections until
  reviewed against newer evidence.
- This policy governs future update work. Existing importers still need an
  explicit implementation and regression pass before claiming game-only sourcing.
- Do not alter UI or planning algorithms as a side effect of changing data
  sources. Review price and dependency diffs before publishing a refreshed snapshot.
